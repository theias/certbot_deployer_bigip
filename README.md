[Certbot Deployer] plugin for deploying certificates to F5 BIG-IP devices

> BIG-IP is a collection of hardware platforms and software solutions providing services focused on security, reliability, and performance. - [What is BIG-IP?]

This tool runs as a [Certbot] "deploy hook", and uploads and installs Certbot certificates to BIG-IP and optionally associates them with a profile.

BIG-IP subcommand
        Certbot Deployer plugin for deploying certificates to F5 BIG-IP devices


options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --host HOST, -H HOST  BIG-IP host to target with changes.
  --dest-temp-dir DEST_DIR_PATH, -t DEST_DIR_PATH
                        The temp path on the BIG-IP to use when uploading the
                        certificates for installation. This tool will try to
                        zero out the certificates at the end of the run once
                        they are ingested into the BIG-IP config, but you
                        should probably try to put them in a "safe" place.
                        Default: `/var/tmp`
  --cert-name CERT_NAME, -c CERT_NAME
                        The name to give the certificate objects on the BIG-
                        IP. If not given, this tool will use the Common Name
                        from the certificate with the ISO8601-formatted `Not
                        After` value appended, e.g. `host.domain.tld.YYY-MM-
                        DDTHH:MM:SS`
  --profile-name PROFILE_NAME, -p PROFILE_NAME
                        The name of the profile to modify/create to use the
                        deployed certificateIf given, the corresponding
                        `--profile-type` is also required. If neither are
                        given, this tool will not create/modify any profiles.
  --profile-type PROFILE_TYPE, -r PROFILE_TYPE
                        The type of profile to create if necessary e.g.
                        `client-ssl`. See BIG-IP docs for details on all
                        profile types. If given, the corresponding `--profile-
                        name` is also required. If neither are given, this
                        tool will not create/modify any profiles.
  --sync-group SYNC_GROUP, -s SYNC_GROUP
                        The sync-group to synchronize to after the
                        certificates are deployed. This tool will not try to
                        sync the BIG-IP node if this argument is not given
  --dry-run, -d         Report the workflow steps that would run without
                        actually running them

Examples:

All examples assume the tool is being run as a Certbot deploy hook, and
the environment variable `RENEWED_LINEAGE` points to the live
certificate directory just updated by Certbot.

    # Install certificate on the BIG-IP device named with its expiry timestamp
    # as `host.domain.tld.YYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS` (the default)

    certbot-deployer bigip --host bigip.domain.tld

    # Install certificate on the BIG-IP device and then synchronize
    # device changes to a device group

    certbot-deployer bigip --host bigip.domain.tld --sync-group yoursyncgroup

    # Install certificate on the BIG-IP device and then associate it
    # with a client-ssl profile. If the profile does not exist, it will be created.

    certbot-deployer bigip --host bigip.domain.tld --profile-name yourprofile \
        --profile-type client-ssl

    # Print out the deployment tasks that would be taken, but do not run them

    certbot-deployer bigip --host bigip.domain.tld --dry-run
```

# Limitations

* "Rollbacks" are not yet implemented (and may not be) in the case of failure during deployment.
    - This should not be able to go more "wrong" than failing to synchronize after modifying a profile (if one is even configured), as no other operations should be touching any existing BIG-IP resources.
